    "# Random Numbers\n",

    "In python there is a bunch of different functions to create random numbers with different distributions. Some of them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `seed(seed)`: Starts the seed of a generator number , this is a number of type ``int``. This is used to change the sequence of generated random numbers.\n",
    "2. `rand(d0,d1,...,dn)`: Returns a multidimensional array of numbers with uniform distribution.\n",
    "3. `randn(d0,d1,...,dn)`: It works the same as before but this time gives a Gaussian standard distribution ($\\mu=0,\\sigma=1$).\n",
    "4. `binomial(M,p,size)`: It returns a sample with binomial distribution with parameters $M$ (trials) y $p$ (probability).\n",
    "5. `poisson(a,size)`: Returns a sample of a Poisson distribution with parameter $a$.\n",
    "6. `choice([-1,1],size)`: Sample form a given array, for this case it will take randomly -1 and 1, it also receives a parameter to specify the probability of choosing each element.\n",
    "7. `normal(ave,std,size)`: Generates a random Gaussian distribution with parameters  $\\mu=$ave y $\\sigma=$std.\n",
    "8. `uniform([low,high,size])`: Generate samples from an uniform distribution in the interval (low,hihg).\n",

    "# Exercise 3 (Poisson limit)\n",
    "Something interesting that emerges form the concentration of the measure (measure theory) is the fact that with some distributions we can get some others distributions, when it happens we say that a random variable converges in distribution to another variable. this is the case of Binomial and the Poissonian distributions. The [Poisson limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_limit_theorem) establish that if $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $p\\rightarrow 0$, keeping the product $np$ constant, we have that the binomial distribution of parameters $n,p$ $\\mathcal{B}(n,p)$, approaches a Poisson distribution of parameter $\\lambda=np$. We can write this in a single mathematical expression as:\n",
