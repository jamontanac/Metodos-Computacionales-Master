    "# Fibonacci Problem\n",
    "Sometimes Recursion comes with a price to pay and this is the time of computation, due to the times it has to call itself (it can grow exponentially with the number of recursions it does. a perfect example of this is Fibonacci sequence. the $n$-th element can be obtained by calling its previous\n",
    "$$F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $F(0)=0, F(1)=1$\n",
    "which means that we can obtain the sequences by calling a function of the previous elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to first implement and see how recursion can make the code grow exponentially in function of $n$. To do this:\n",
    "1. make a function that is going to be called ``fib_recursion`` which is gonna take $n$ as a parameter and returns the $n$-th term of the Fibonacci sequence. Test your code with $n<30$.\n",
    "your code should look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib_recursion(n):\n",
    "    #Your answer here\n",
    "    return n_fibonacci\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. In order to observe the performance of this routine make a loop in which $n$ varies from 1 to 40 and register the time each iteration takes to compute. to do this you'll have to use a library called ``time``, and it can be called as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "for i in range(n):\n",
    "    init=time.time()\n",
    "    #your process\n",
    "    difference_time=time.time()-init\n",
    "```\n",
    "So keep the times of each iteration and the number of the iteration in different lists (to do this use the append method) and then plot the time taken in function of the number of the iteration. To plot use the next command\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pylab as plt\n",
    "plt.plot(list_of_n,list_of_times)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. That was the warm up, now we are going to implement an optimization of the last function. to do this you can see that the Fibonacci sequence can be done without calling many times itself, now implement a function that takes the a number $n$ and returns the $n$-th term of the Fibonacci sequence. To do this see that you can start with $a=1,b=0$ and then create the new term by doing \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a <-- a+b\n",
    "b <-- a\n",
    "```\n",
    "if you get confused check this [Help](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_sec_1.2.4) to guide you in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once you implemented your code test it again with little numbers and repeat the same part of the 3-th numeral and measure the time it take to compute the first 100 Fibonacci numbers and plot it.\n",
    "What is the main difference you notice in both plots. what can you conclude about the first method implemented?.\n",
    "Give a reason why it is so different and why they can be that different if they are both doing the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
